# Arcade

2nd project of the OOP (Oriented Object Programming) cursus.

The goal of the project was to recreate an arcade terminal by being able to change the graphic library and the game at runtime without the program stopping.

## Documentation

1. There is a `arcade_documentation.pdf` file in `./doc` that explain our project architecture and explain how to add a new graphical or game library that fit with our project.
2. Generate documentation about our code
```
# Generate Doxygen documentation (./doc/html/index.html)
make docs

# Delete Doxygen documentation directory
make clean_docs
```

## Testing time!
All tests files are in `./tests` directory
```
# Generate tests binary
make unit_tests
